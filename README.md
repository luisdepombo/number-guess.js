# number-guess.js
number-guess.js is a terminal app single-player game that can be played using the Node runtime environment. The player enters numbers to attempt to guess the number randomly generated by the program.

This app uses the [prompt-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync) Node dependency to ask the user for new player guess.

## Usage
To start playing, open the repository/folder in your terminal and run the commands:
```
npm install
node game.js
```
Then follow the instructions at the terminal/prompt to complete the game.
